title: Traitor

As an action, select a creature that is not another domain's leader that you can see
within 30 feet of you, and take all the power dice from your domain's pool. If the 
target's current hit points are equal to or less than the total of the power dice times
your domain size, the target turns traitor and serves you as a retainer, or is revealed
to secretly already be in your service.
